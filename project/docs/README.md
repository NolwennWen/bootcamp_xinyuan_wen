# Stock Price Prediction

**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement

Accurately predicting stock prices can help investors and portfolio managers make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding assets. This project aims to predict the next-day closing price of selected stocks using historical price, trading volume and other available data. This may improve investment strategies, optimize trade timing, and reduce exposure to unexpected price swings.

## Stakeholder & User

- Who decides?: Portfolio managers or investment analysts decide on trade execution and portfolio allocation.
- Who uses the output?: Traders and retail investors use predictions to guide daily trading decisions.
- Timing: Predictions must be available before market open each day, using the most recent available data.

## Useful Answer & Decision

Predictive
Metric: Predicted next-day closing price for each stock with a short explanatory note.

## Assumptions & Constraints

Historical daily stock price and volume data is accessible from public APIs.
Assume data is mostly clean. Missing or erroneous values can be handled with standard preprocessing.
Calculations and model training can be done on a standard laptop.

## Known Unknowns / Risks

1. Sudden market-moving news
    Compare predicted vs actual prices daily and flag large deviations.
2. Delayed or missing API data
    Implement automated data validation or fallback to previous day’s data if missing.
3. Model overfitting
    Use cross-validation.

## Lifecycle Mapping

- Define prediction problem & scope → Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01) → README.md + stakeholder memo.

- Set up development environment and repo structure → Tooling Setup (Stage 02) → GitHub repo initialized (/data/, /src/, /notebooks/, /docs/).

- Ensure Python workflow & reproducibility → Python Fundamentals (Stage 03) → Jupyter notebooks + Python scripts with functions for preprocessing & modeling.

- Ingest historical financial data from APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, Tiingo) → Data Acquisition/Ingestion (Stage 04) → Raw dataset in /data/raw/.

- Store raw and processed data in organized directories → Data Storage (Stage 05) → /data/raw/, /data/processed/ with data dictionary.

- Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, adjust for stock splits, normalize volume) → Data Preprocessing (Stage 06) → Cleaned dataset + preprocessing scripts.

- Detect and handle anomalies (outlier daily returns, extreme volume spikes, erroneous data) → Outlier Analysis (Stage 07) → Outlier detection report + Winsorizing/IQR filtering.

- Explore historical price behavior and trading patterns → Exploratory Data Analysis (Stage 08) → EDA notebook with summary statistics + visualizations.

- Engineer predictive features (lagged returns, moving averages, volatility, momentum indicators) → Feature Engineering (Stage 09) → Feature summary table + engineered dataset.

- Build predictive models (linear regression, time series models, or machine learning regressors) → Modeling (Stage 10) → Trained model artifacts + baseline comparison.

- Evaluate model accuracy & risks (MAE, RMSE, R², overfitting checks, stress tests with outliers) → Evaluation & Risk Communication (Stage 11) → Evaluation report + risk discussion.

- Prepare stakeholder-ready deliverables (charts, explanations, daily prediction CSV) → Results Reporting, Delivery Design & Stakeholder Communication (Stage 12) → Presentation slides + stakeholder memo.

- Package pipeline for reuse (functions for data download, preprocessing, feature generation) → Productization (Stage 13) → Modularized Python package in /src/.

- Deploy daily prediction workflow (automated script to fetch new data, run model, export results) → Deployment & Monitoring (Stage 14) → Automated prediction CSV (/data/predictions/) + daily explanatory note.

- Monitor model drift and system performance (compare predicted vs actual, send alerts if deviations > threshold) → Orchestration & System Design (Stage 15) → Monitoring dashboard + anomaly alerts.

## Repo Plan

- /data/: raw and processed stock data.
- /src/: Python scripts for data collection and modeling.
- /notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- /docs/: stakeholder memo, documentation, etc.
