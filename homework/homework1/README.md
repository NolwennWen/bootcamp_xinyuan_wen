# Stock Price Prediction
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)
## Problem Statement
Accurately predicting stock prices can help investors and portfolio managers make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding assets. This project aims to predict the next-day closing price of selected stocks using historical price, trading volume and other available data. This may improve investment strategies, optimize trade timing, and reduce exposure to unexpected price swings.
## Stakeholder & User
Who decides?: Portfolio managers or investment analysts decide on trade execution and portfolio allocation.
Who uses the output?: Traders and retail investors use predictions to guide daily trading decisions.
Timing: Predictions must be available before market open each day, using the most recent available data.
## Useful Answer & Decision
Predictive
Metric: Predicted next-day closing price for each stock with a short explanatory note.
## Assumptions & Constraints
Historical daily stock price and volume data is accessible from public APIs.
Assume data is mostly clean. Missing or erroneous values can be handled with standard preprocessing.
Calculations and model training can be done on a standard laptop.
## Known Unknowns / Risks
1. Sudden market-moving news
    Compare predicted vs actual prices daily and flag large deviations.
2. Delayed or missing API data
    Implement automated data validation or fallback to previous day’s data if missing.
3. Model overfitting
    Use cross-validation.
